Vishnje is a plotting tool, and a d3.js_ playground for `python 3`_.

The purpose of the project is to leverage d3_ power for a desktop user which
can understand python and javascript, in order to visualize data quickly.

The project is based upon CherryPy, in order to run a rough web-based desktop
application.
