### Why does it look like a tornado?

The higher circles move on the orizontal axis as if they had more
inertia, because they represent many points. Thus, when older values
are added, it is very difficult that thay may change the direction of
the plot

On the other end, the first circle represents just itself, and the
other lower circles represent a few points. Thus if these points have
different values, this may affect highly the circle position
